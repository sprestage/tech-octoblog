<h2>Setting up a new project</h2>

<h3>Set up the local repository</h3>

<p>Brand new project.  Start in the project directory.  Then:</p>

<pre>
  $ git init
</pre>


<p>Ready to stage your commits?  Here is the long way:</p>

<pre>
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
</pre>


<p>Here is a useful short way to do both of the above commands at once:</p>

<pre>
  $ git commit -am "Initial commit"
</pre>


<h3>Set up remote repository</h3>

<p>Point to a new repo on github.  Note: must create this new repo on github first!</p>

<pre>
  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/&ltusername>/&ltyour_new_app_name>.git
</pre>


<p>Show the remote repositories that are being pointed to:</p>

<pre>
  $ git remote -v
</pre>


<p>List remote and local branches:</p>

<pre>
  $ git branch -a
</pre>


<p>Push to github:</p>

<pre>
  $ git push -u origin master
</pre>


<h3>Set up Heroku</h3>

<p>First, go to Heroku and create a new repo.
Next, push to heroku:</p>

<pre>
  $ heroku create
  $ git push heroku master
  $ heroku run rake db:migrate
</pre>


<p>Further pushes to heroku</p>

<pre>
  $ git push heroku master
</pre>


<p>If you encounter problems, this will show you the logs on Heroku for diagnostics</p>

<pre>
  $ heroku logs
</pre>


<h2>Frequent staging, commiting, and pushing</h2>

<p>Even better is that if you are working offline, you can keep staging and committing.  Then push all to the remote repository at once when you have internet connectivity again.</p>

<pre>
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "brief explanation of changes here"
  $ git push
</pre>


<h3>What is the status of your files</h3>

<p>How is git looking (you will find some useful guidance printed out with this command too):</p>

<pre>
  $ git status
</pre>


<h1>Branching</h1>

<h3>New branch exists on remote</h3>

<h4>New branches on github</h4>

<p>So, your teammate has been working on a new branch they just created and then commited to github.  You now want to start working locally on that new branch.</p>

<pre>
  $ git fetch origin bug-request-id
  $ git checkout bug-request-id
</pre>


<h4>Several new branches on github</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been heads down on your work on a branch and your team has created several new branches remotely on github and now you need to start contributing to those branches.  To get look at what the remote branches are,</p>

<pre>
  $ git fetch
</pre>


<p>Now you will see everything on the remote when you want to list your local and remote branches with this command:</p>

<pre>
  $ git branch -a
</pre>


<p>Finally, to bring the remote branch code down to your local, once you fetched:</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout bug-request-id
</pre>


<h3>Create new branch locally</h3>

<h4>Starting the new branch locally</h4>

<p>First, create the branch locally.  This automatically changes you to this branch locally.</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout -b new_branch_name
</pre>


<h4>Pushing the new branch to github</h4>

<p>To check this into github, do this and the new branch will automatically get created on github,
then your code will get pushed into that branch.</p>

<pre>
  $ git push origin new_branch_name
</pre>


<h3>Good git references</h3>

<p>Also very useful are these links:
<a href="http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace;">http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace;</a>
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">http://git-scm.com/book</a>
<a href="http://techblog.susanprestage.com/blog/2013/12/02/my-personal-git-command-reference/">http://techblog.susanprestage.com/blog/2013/12/02/my-personal-git-command-reference/</a></p>

<h3>Working with a branch</h3>

<p>Use this to confirm WHICH branch you are on.</p>

<pre>
  $ git branch
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "a good commit message"
  $ git push origin new_branch_name
</pre>


<p>Very important tips for switching between branches.  ALWAYS commit your changes to your current branch before changing branches.  I assumed the files would stay in the old branch as I switched to the new branch, but NO.  The changes will follow you around like a lost puppy until you commit them.</p>

<h3>Merging your branch(es)</h3>

<p>Ok, I&rsquo;ve got this branch (or worse, several branches).  I&rsquo;m done working on them.  They are all checked in, as branches.  But now, I need to get the master branch back up to date.  How do I do this with FIVE branches.  Don&rsquo;t panic, we can do this thing.  First, make sure everything is up to date and checked in.</p>

<pre>
  $ git status
</pre>


<p>Then, get onto the master branch.</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout master
</pre>


<p>Now we are going to merge each branch in, push it to github, and then delete the branch since we are done with them.  Skip the last step if you aren&rsquo;t quite done with the branch.</p>

<pre>
  $ git merge chapter_2
  $ git push origin master    (also can just usually say 'git push' here)
  $ git branch -d chapter_2

  $ git merge chapter_3
  $ git push
  $ git branch -d chapter_3
</pre>


<p>Repeat until you&rsquo;ve merged in each branch.  Yeay!  This worked for me and I saw what I wanted on github.  I have both the branches I expect as well as each branch merge present as a commit on the master.  Excellent!  Git is starting to be a Very useful tool instead of an occasional impediment.  :)</p>

<h1>Stashing</h1>

<p>In the middle of some work on another branch and have to interrupt and get back to the master for some reason?  Do this.  First see what you are working on</p>

<pre>
  $ git diff
</pre>


<p>Save working directory and index state WIP on my_branch and restores last commit.</p>

<pre>
  $ git stash save
</pre>


<p>Now these return nothing</p>

<pre>
  $ git diff
  $ git status
</pre>


<p>Now get back to master and update:</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout master
  $ git pull
</pre>


<p>When done, get back to our stashed work:</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout my_branch
  $ git stash apply
</pre>


<p>Verify we are in the same place:</p>

<pre>
  $ git diff

  $ git stash list
  $ git stash apply stash@{1}
  $ git stash drop
</pre>


<h2>Whoops!  Now what do I do?</h2>

<p>To check out a particular commit, use</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout &ltsha1>
</pre>


<p>To revert changes made to your working copy, do this</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout .
</pre>


<p>This will create three separate revert commits:</p>

<pre>
  $ git revert 0766c053 25eee4ca a867b4af
</pre>


<p>It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:</p>

<pre>
  $ git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
</pre>


<p>To get just one, you could use <code>rebase -i</code> to squash them afterwards  Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo) get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .
</pre>


<p>and then commit</p>

<pre>
  $ git commit    # be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
</pre>


<p>I don&rsquo;t like my past several commits.  I want to go back to a particular commit.  Reset may be a BAD, BAD way of doing things, so look out!</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset --hard HEAD~5
</pre>


<h2>Powerful commands</h2>

<p>Stuff I&rsquo;m using regularly these days</p>

<h3>Unstage</h3>

<p>Reset the staging area to match the most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages all files without overwriting any changes, giving you the opportunity to re-build the staged snapshot from scratch.</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset
</pre>


<p>Reset the staging area and the working directory to match the most recent commit. In addition to unstaging changes, the &ndash;hard flag tells Git to overwrite all changes in the working directory, too. Put another way: this obliterates all uncommitted changes, so make sure you really want to throw away your local developments before using it.</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset --hard
</pre>


<p>Careful: <code>git reset &ndash;hard</code> WILL DELETE YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY CHANGES. Be sure to stash any local changes you want to keep before running this command.</p>

<p>Assuming you are sitting on that commit, then this command will wack it&hellip;</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset --hard HEAD~1
</pre>


<p>The HEAD~1 means the commit before head.</p>

<p>Or, you could look at the output of git log, find the commit id of the commit you want to back up to, and then do this:</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>
</pre>


<p>If you REALLY want to rewrite history.  Think very, very carefully about this BEFORE doing it.</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset --hard <old-commit-id>
  $ git push -f
</pre>


<h3>Switch to specific commit</h3>

<p>Temporarily switch to a different commit</p>

<p>If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:</p>

<pre>
  # This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:

  $ git checkout 0d1d7fc32
</pre>


<p>Or if you want to make commits while you&rsquo;re there, go ahead and make a new branch while you&rsquo;re at it:</p>

<pre>
  git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32
</pre>


<h3>Merge</h3>

<p>How to merge the master branch into the feature branch? Easy:</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout feature1
  $ git merge master
</pre>


<p>Merge branch back into master</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout master
  $ git merge my_branch
</pre>


<h3>Merge conflict</h3>

<p>When there is a conflict during a merge, you have to finish the merge commit manually. It sounds like you&rsquo;ve done the first two steps, to edit the files that conflicted and then run</p>

<pre>
  $ git add
</pre>


<p>on them to mark them as resolved.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to actually commit the merge with</p>

<pre>
  $ git commit
</pre>


<p>after which you will be able to switch branches again.</p>

<h3>Have I forgotten to push?</h3>

<p>How do I tell if my commited changes have been pushed to github?</p>

<pre>
  $ git log origin/master..HEAD
</pre>


<p>You can also view the diff using the same syntax</p>

<pre>
  $ git diff origin/master..HEAD
</pre>


<h3>Duplicate a branch</h3>

<p>Copy old_branch into a new_branch.  (Useful for trying out a merge you are worried about.)</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout old_branch
  $ git branch new_branch
  $ git checkout new_branch
</pre>


<h3>Destroy local branch</h3>

<p>Get rid of a branch and everything in it changed or not.  (Useful after you&rsquo;ve tried out a merge on a temporary branch.)</p>

<p>First, you have to get rid of the changes:</p>

<pre>
  $ git reset --hard HEAD
</pre>


<p>Next, change to a different, good branch</p>

<pre>
  $ git checkout master
</pre>


<p>Lastly, delete the branch</p>

<pre>
  $ git branch -d temporary_branch
</pre>


<p>you may need to use a -D option to force this.  BE CAREFUL not to delete something you care about.  Really!</p>

<h3>Tidy up leftovers</h3>

<p>Once you delete the branch from the remote, you can prune to get rid of remote tracking branches with:</p>

<pre>
  $ git branch -r -d origin/newfeaturebranch
</pre>


<p>This will prune All of your old references to already-deleted-on-github branches.</p>

<pre>
  $ git remote prune origin
</pre>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>Getting past my fear of Git</h2>

<p>Git kept scaring me.  Mostly, this fear is based on how wonderfully powerful a tool that Git (and github) can be and my lack of easy comfort with the commands.  So, I&rsquo;ve made a list of my most used commands and any notes I need for use.  This goes a bit long, since as I learned more and more commands, I added more that I was starting to use.  Good luck!</p>

<h2>What is Git</h2>

<h4>Basics</h4>

<p>Git is a version control system, VCS.  Don&rsquo;t think too carefully about the other VCSs you know, like Perforce or Subversion.  Git is much different and trying to compare will likely cause confusion.</p>

<h4>Snapshots, instead of differences</h4>

<p>Most other systems tend to store data as changes to a base version of each file.  Git doesn&rsquo;t think of it&rsquo;s data that way.  Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a mini-filesystem.  And, to be efficient, Git only takes a snapshot of the files that have changed, simply linking to all the other files that have not changed.</p>

<h4>Local</h4>

<p>Most operations you perform with Git will be local. The entire history of your repository will be right there on your machine, which means that diffs and browsing the history of your project is very quick.  This also means that working offline is not a problem.  You simply commit all you like while offline, then push your work up to the remote repository server when you get back to a network connection.</p>

<h4>The Three States of Git</h4>

<h6>1. The Working Directory</h6>

<h6>2. The Staging Area</h6>

<h6>3. The Git Repository</h6>

<p><a target="_blank" href="#blog"><img class="img-portfolio img-responsive" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/technicalblog/three_states_of_git.png" width="340" height="284"></a></p>

<p>Git has three main states that your files can reside in: commited, modified, and staged.  Commited means that the data is safely stored in your local repository.  Modified means that you have changed the file, but not yet commited it to your local repository.  Staged means that you have marked a modified file to go into your next commit snapshot.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check out the project to bring the files from the git repository into your working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Stage your files to bring those changes from your working directory to the staging area.</p></li>
<li><p>Commit your files to bring the changes from the staging area to the git repository.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Your workflow will be something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modify files in your working directory.</li>
<li>Stage the files.  This adds snapshots of them to the staging area.</li>
<li>Commit your changes.  This takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot in your git repository.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Getting started with Git</h2>

<p>To install and setup Git, go here and follow the very good instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I highly recommend the entire <a href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">http://git-scm.com/documentation</a> site.  For a more thorough explanation of Git, what it is and how it works, I particularly recommend this chapter <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics.">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics.</a></p>

<h2>Final notes on Git</h2>

<p>I have found that it is important to stage and commit your files often and in small increments.  Any time you have a change that makes sense as its own commit, do so.  If what you are working on is so big that you think you ought to wait to commit, then I strongly recommend branching and then again you should be able to break down your commits within that branch.  You really want to be able to track what you did later, both for yourself and for others trying to maintain your code.</p>
